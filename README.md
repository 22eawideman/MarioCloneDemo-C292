# Introduction to Game Programming CSCI-C292
This is our repository for the game we will be all making in lab together. Please follow along and add all the individual mechanics that we show in lab.
After you have added the mechanics we show you, please feel free to modify them to make your game unique to what you want!
Here are some ideas on how to make your game more unique:
- Use different art assets.
- Change the values for movement speeds, jumping height, damage dealt, hitpoints, etc. to whatever feels fun to you.
- Create your own unique layout for the level.
- Add anything extra that we don't cover during the lab demonstrations!
